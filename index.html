          The optimal functioning of the human body is closely intertwined with
          a triad of crucial factors: exercise, nutrition, and sleep. Regular
          physical exercise not only enhances physical fitness but also supports
          cardiovascular health, maintains weight, and stimulates the release of
          endorphins contributing to overall mental well-being. A balanced diet,
          rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, provides the body with the
          fuel it needs for optimal functioning, boosts the immune system, and
          aids in disease prevention. It is crucial to find a balanced approach,
          emphasizing the overall structure of the diet rather than focusing
          solely on individual components. Lastly, quality sleep is
          indispensable. Regular physical training, proper nutrition, and
          adequate sleep are interconnected elements crucial for maintaining
          optimal physical and mental health.
        </p>
        <p>Let's focus on these 3 fundamentals of a healthy lifestyle:</p>

        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p>
          Maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet is paramount for promoting
          overall health and well-being. The food we consume serves as the fuel
          for our bodies, influencing not only our physical health but also our
          mental acuity. A well-rounded diet, rich in essential nutrients,
          vitamins, and minerals, plays a fundamental role in preventing chronic
          illnesses and supporting the body's various functions.
        </p>

          class="zoomable img-wrapped-text-left"
        />
        <p>
          Adequate nutrition is integral for sustaining energy levels and
          enhancing productivity. A diet centered around whole foods such as
          fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains provides the
          necessary nutrients for optimal cognitive function. Furthermore,
          proper nutrition is instrumental in supporting a healthy metabolism,
          aiding in weight management, and reducing the risk of conditions like
          diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the physical aspects, the connection between diet and mental
          health is increasingly recognized. Certain foods can influence mood
          and cognitive performance, emphasizing the importance of a holistic
          approach to health. By adopting a mindful and balanced approach to
          eating, individuals can nurture their bodies, improve digestion, and
          cultivate a positive relationship with food. Ultimately, a
          well-balanced diet is not a restrictive measure but a cornerstone of a
          vibrant and thriving life.

      <!-- Training section -->
      <section id="section-training">
        <h1>Training</h1>
        <p>
          Regular exercise is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle, offering
          numerous physical and mental benefits. First and foremost, it is a
          crucial factor in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing a range
          of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.
          Additionally, exercise is instrumental in enhancing cardiovascular
          health, improving circulation, and boosting overall immunity.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/training_exercises.jpg"
          alt="training exercises"
          class="zoomable img-wrapped-text-right"
        />
        <p>
          Beyond the physical advantages, regular physical activity plays a
          pivotal role in mental well-being. Engaging in exercise releases
          endorphins, often referred to as "feel-good" hormones, which can
          alleviate stress and elevate mood. Moreover, the discipline and
          routine established through regular workouts can positively impact
          one's mental resilience and ability to cope with life's challenges. In
          essence, exercise is not just a means to maintain physical fitness; it
          is a holistic approach to ensuring a healthier and more balanced life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fast-paced and often sedentary nature of modern life, carving
          out time for regular exercise is an investment in long-term health.
          Whether it's a brisk walk, a challenging workout, or a calming yoga
          session, incorporating physical activity into one's routine is a
          commitment to overall well-being and vitality. Embracing an active
          lifestyle is not only about looking good but, more importantly, about
          feeling good, both physically and mentally.
        </p>

      <!-- Sleep section -->
      <section id="section-sleep">
        <h1>Sleep</h1>
        <p>
          Quality sleep is a cornerstone of a healthy and fulfilling life. In a
          world where schedules are hectic and demands are high, the importance
          of prioritizing sufficient and restorative sleep cannot be overstated.
          Adequate sleep is essential for physical recovery, mental
          rejuvenation, and overall cognitive function.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/sleep_cycle.jpg"
          alt="sleep cycle"
          class="zoomable img-wrapped-text-left"
        />
        <p>
          During sleep, the body undergoes crucial processes, including tissue
          repair, immune system strengthening, and the consolidation of
          memories. A consistent and restful sleep routine is directly linked to
          improved concentration, better decision-making, and heightened
          creativity. Furthermore, it plays a pivotal role in regulating mood,
          reducing stress, and promoting emotional resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a society where digital screens and busy lifestyles often encroach
          upon bedtime, recognizing the significance of sleep hygiene is vital.
          Creating a conducive sleep environment, establishing a consistent
          sleep schedule, and practicing relaxation techniques contribute to a
          more profound and restful sleep. Prioritizing quality sleep is not
          just a luxury but a necessity for achieving and sustaining optimal
          physical and mental health.
